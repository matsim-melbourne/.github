# Activity-based and agent-based Transport model of Melbourne (AToM)

AToM is a city-scale, multi-modal transport simulation model that represents a typical mid-weekday in Melbourne's transportation system for the purpose of understanding its complexities. The AToM workflow, shown in Figure 1, consists of open-source tools with the MATSim simulation toolkit serving as the core traffic simulator. These open-source tools include an [activity-based transport demand generator](https://github.com/matsim-melbourne/demand), a [road and public transport network generator](https://github.com/matsim-melbourne/network), a [mode choice model](https://github.com/matsim-melbourne/choice-model), and [a set of MATSim simulation output and input post-processing tools](https://github.com/matsim-melbourne/useful-scripts).

AToM is actively being developed and used to test various scenarios. Notable examples include modeling the impact of the full development of Melbourne's Strategic Cycling Corridors, as well as Phase 1 of Melbourne's Suburban Rail Loop project.
