# Activity-based and agent-based Transport model of Melbourne (AToM)

AToM is a city-scale multi-modal transport simulation, modelling a typical mid-weekday day in the transportation system of Melbourne for understanding. 
AToM workflow, Figure 1, constists of open-source tools with MATSim simulation toolkit as the core traffic simulator. 
The open-source tools include an activity-based transport demand generator](https://github.com/matsim-melbourne/demand), a [road and public transport network genereator](https://github.com/matsim-melbourne/network), a [mode choice model](https://github.com/matsim-melbourne/choice-model), and [a set of MATSim simulation output and input postprocessing tools](https://github.com/matsim-melbourne/useful-scripts).

AToM is being actively developed and used to test different scenrarios. Notable examples include modelling impact of full development of the Strategic Cycling Corridors in Melbourne, modelling the Phase 1 of the Melbourne's Surbun Rail Loop project.
